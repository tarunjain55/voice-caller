# Voice Caller 

The Twilio Voice JavaScript SDK allows you to make voice calls to and from a web browser and a Twilio TwiML Voice Application. This means you can open inbound and outbound audio connections to Twilio for building softphones, walkie-talkies, conference calls, click-to-talk systems, and more, all from the browser.
